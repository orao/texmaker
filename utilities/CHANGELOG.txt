version 1.3 -> 1.4 :
----------------------
- Spell checking has been added (aspell is required)
- Support for the main pstricks commands has been added
- The html conversion tool is now available on windows (only ghostscript is required)
- The editor checks now the braces
- The syntax highlighter can now detect the math mode "\[ \]"
- Tex files can now be dragged from a file manager to texmaker
- minor bugfixes (replace dialog, close event...)
version 1.2.1 -> 1.3 :
----------------------
- Texmaker is now a pure QT4 program (qt >= 4.1 is required). The qt3 support library is no more required. The editor is now based on the qt4 QtextEdit object and the symbols icon view is an qt4 QTableWidget object.
- For each file, three bookmarks can be used to speed up navigation.

version 1.2 -> 1.2.1 : Bugs fixed
---------------------------------
- Don't use anymore double-clic to open a file from the structure view (Qt-4.0.0 bug). A simple clic must be used now.
- Don't use anymore / to separate commands (quick build and users commands) but | to avoid confusion with the directories separator.
- A selected icon is no more highlighted (trouble on windows and macosx - the selected icon was masked).
- Added the option '-line' for the application.
