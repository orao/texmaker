version 1.2 -> 1.2.1 : Bugs fixed
---------------------------------
- Don't use anymore double-clic to open a file from the structure view (Qt-4.0.0 bug). A simple clic must be used now.
- Don't use anymore / to separate commands (quick build and users commands) but | to avoid confusion with the directories separator.
- A selected icon is no more highlighted (trouble on windows and macosx - the selected icon was masked).
- Added the option '-line' for the application.
