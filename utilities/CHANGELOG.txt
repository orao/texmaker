2) The structure of the source package has been modified :
    - dictionaries/ subfolder : spell dictionaries (must be installed in the PREFIX/share/texmaker directory for linux)
    - locale/ subfolder : all the translations (must be installed in the PREFIX/share/texmaker directory for linux)
    - doc/ subfolder : all the files needed for the documentation (must be installed in the PREFIX/share/texmaker directory for linux)
    - utilities/ subfolder : icons, desktop file, changelog, COPYING, AUTORS, files needed by the "html export" tool (blank.png, next_d.gif, next.gif, prev_d.gif, prev.gif, psheader.txt, style.css, up_d.gif, up.gif) etc... (must be installed in the PREFIX/share/texmaker directory for linux)
The others subfolders (completion/hunspell/images/spell/symbols/tags/singleapp) are only used for compilation (no installation to do)
